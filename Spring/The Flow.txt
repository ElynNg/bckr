# Code Flow Overview

## Client Request
1. The client (frontend) sends an HTTP request to the server via an API endpoint (e.g., `POST /faq`, `GET /faq`).

## Controller Layer
1. The controller (`FaqController`) receives the request.
2. It delegates the work to the service layer (`FaqService`), passing the request data.

## Service Layer
1. The service layer (`FaqServiceImpl`) processes the request, possibly interacting with the repository layer to retrieve or save data.
2. It also converts entities into DTOs before returning the data to the controller.

## Repository Layer
1. The repository (`FaqRepository`) is responsible for interacting directly with the database, saving, finding, and deleting `Faq` entities.

## Response to Client
1. The controller sends the response data back to the client. For instance, after creating a new FAQ, the `FaqResponse` DTO is returned with the FAQ data.
